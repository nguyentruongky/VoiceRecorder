# Audio Notes App

A simple and elegant iOS application for recording, managing, and playing audio notes.

## Features

- **Audio Recording**: Create high-quality audio recordings with a beautiful, intuitive interface
- **Notes Management**: View, play, and organize your audio recordings in a clean list view

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

This app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to maintain a clean separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Core data models like `AudioNote` to represent recordings
- **ViewModels**: Classes like `AudioNoteViewModel` that handle business logic and state management
- **Views**: SwiftUI views that provide the user interface

### Key Components

- **AudioRecorder**: Handles audio recording with proper permission management and error handling
- **AudioPlayer**: Manages audio playback with support for interruptions and session management

### Design Decisions

1. **SwiftUI**: Chosen for its declarative syntax and seamless integration with iOS
2. **Combine Framework**: Used for reactive programming and state management
3. **AVFoundation**: Leveraged for audio recording and playback capabilities
4. **Background Processing**: File operations run in background threads to keep the UI responsive
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly alerts

## Future Improvements

- **Audio Visualization**: Add waveform visualization during recording and playback
- **Categories and Tags**: Allow users to organize recordings with custom categories
- **Cloud Sync**: Add iCloud integration for syncing recordings across devices
- **Search Functionality**: Implement search to quickly find recordings by title or content
- **Audio Transcription**: Add speech-to-text capabilities to make recordings searchable
- **Audio Editing**: Allow trimming and basic editing of recordings
- **Sharing Options**: Add the ability to share recordings via various channels
- **Dark Mode Optimization**: Further enhance the dark mode experience
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure the app is fully accessible to all users
